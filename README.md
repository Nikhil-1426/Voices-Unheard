## Voices Unheard 

## üí° Introduction:

**Problem Statement**: Underrepresented communities often struggle to find dedicated platforms that amplify their voices, facilitate community-driven initiatives, and provide economic opportunities. Existing platforms do not cater specifically to their unique needs, making it difficult for individuals to share their experiences, organize events, access educational resources, or support community-driven businesses effectively.

**Solution**: Voices Unheard is a community-driven platform that empowers underrepresented individuals by providing a dedicated space for expression, collaboration, and economic growth. It offers a personalized feed for sharing stories, a community section for organizing events and donations, an education hub for career advancement, and a marketplace for buying and selling products within the community. Through seamless integration with Flutter, Firebase, Supabase and Stripe, it ensures secure authentication, streamlined event planning, and efficient financial transactions.
